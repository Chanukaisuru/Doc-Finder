            <h2>What Does it Mean to be Overweight?</h2><br>
            <p>Being overweight means having a body weight that is higher than what is considered healthy for a given height. This condition is determined using the Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure that takes into account both height and weight. When someone has a BMI between 25 and 29.9, they are classified as overweight. Beyond these numbers, obesity begins, which is a more severe form of excess weight

            <h2>The Health Risks Associated with Being Overweight</h2><br>
            <p>Carrying extra weight puts individuals at a higher risk for a range of diet-related, non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These conditions include:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Diseases:</strong>Excess weight increases the likelihood of heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death globally.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes: </strong>Overweight individuals are more prone to developing insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition with serious health complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Certain Cancers: </strong>Being overweight is linked to several types of cancer, including breast, colon, and kidney cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Musculoskeletal Disorders:</strong>Conditions such as osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, are more common in overweight individuals due to the extra pressure on joints.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiratory Problems:</strong>Excess weight can contribute to sleep apnea and other respiratory issues.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Causes of Overweight</h2><br>
            <p>Several factors contribute to being overweight:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poor Diet:</strong>Consuming high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, and beverages.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Physical Activity:</strong>Sedentary lifestyles decrease the number of calories burned, leading to weight gain.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetics: </strong>Some people are genetically predisposed to gain weight more easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Factors: </strong>Stress, depression, and other emotional issues can lead to overeating or unhealthy eating habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic Factors: </strong>Limited access to healthy food options and recreational facilities can contribute to weight gain.</li>
            </ul>
